	The best reason not to hack the core files is that whatever you might be doing has to be reworked as a patch.

===========================================================================
===========================================================================
=> Consider the following code snippet. Briefly explain what changes it will achieve, who can and cannot view its effects, and at what URL WordPress will make it available.
add_action('admin_menu', 'custom_menu');
function custom_menu(){
    add_menu_page('Custom Menu', 'Custom Menu', 'manage_options', 'custom-menu-slug', 'custom_menu_page_display');
}
function custom_menu_page_display(){
    echo '<h1>Hello World</h1>';
    echo '<p>This is a custom page</p>';
}

	This will add a new menu item labelled “Custom Menu” to the side menu of the WordPress dashboard. When you click on this menu item, WordPress will call the function ‘custom_menu_page_display’ and show a page titled “Custom Menu”, with the heading “Hello World” and a paragraph that reads “This is a custom page”.

	With default settings and roles, admins can view it and all lower roles can’t. In fact this menu item will only be visible to users who have the privilege to “manage options” or change settings from WordPress admin dashboard.

	The admin custom page will be made available at this (relative) URL: “?page=custom-menu-slug”.

=> How would you change all the occurrences of “Hello” into “Good Morning” in post/page contents, when viewed before 11AM?
	In a plugin or in theme functions file, we must create a function that takes text as input, changes it as needed, and returns it. This function must be added as a filter for “the_content”.

	It’s important that we put a little effort to address some details:

	Only change when we have the full isolate substring “hello”. This will prevent words like “Schellong” from becoming “sgood morningng”. To do that we must use “word boundary” anchors in regular expression, putting the word between a pair of “\b”.
	Keep consistency with the letter case. An easy way to do that is to make the replace case sensitive.
	<?php
	function replace_hello($the_content){
	    if(current_time('G')<=10){
	        $the_content=preg_replace('/\bhello\b/','good morning',$the_content);
	        $the_content=preg_replace('/\bHello\b/','Good Morning',$the_content);
	    }
	    return $the_content;
	}
	add_filter('the_content', 'replace_hello');

=> What is the $wpdb variable in WordPress, and how can you use it to improve the following code?
<?php
function perform_database_action(){
    mysql_query(“INSERT into table_name (col1, col2, col3) VALUES ('$value1','$value2', '$value3');
} ?>
	$wpdb is a global variable that contains the WordPress database object. It can be used to perform custom database actions on the WordPress database. It provides the safest means for interacting with the WordPress database.

	The code above doesn’t follow WordPress best practices which strongly discourages the use of any mysql_query call. Wordpress provides easier and safer solutions through $wpdb.

	The above code can be modified to be as follows:

	<?php
	function perform_database_action(){
	    global $wpdb;
	    $data= array('col1'=>$value1,'col2'=>$value2,'col3'=>$value3);
	    $format = array('%s','%s','%s');
	    $wpdb->insert('table_name', $data, $format);
	}

=> Consider the following code snippet and explain the purpose of wp_enqueue_script. Can you figure out if something is wrong in the snippet?
add_custom_script();
function add_custom_script(){
    wp_enqueue_script(
        'jquery-custom-script',
        plugin_dir_url( __FILE__ ).'js/jquery-custom-script.js'
    );
}

	wp_enqueue_script is usually used to inject javascript files in HTML.
	The script we are trying to queue will not be added, because “add_custom_script()” is called with no hooks. To make this work properly we must use the wp_enqueue_scripts hook. Some other hooks will also work such as init, wp_print_scripts, and wp_head.
	Furthermore, since the script seems to be dependent on jQuery, it’s recommended to declare it as such by adding array(‘jquery’) as the 3rd parameter.

	Proper use:
	add_action(‘wp_enqueue_scripts’, ‘add_custom_script’);
	function add_custom_script(){
	    wp_enqueue_script(
	        'jquery-custom-script',
	        plugin_dir_url( __FILE__ ).'js/jquery-custom-script.js',
	        array( 'jquery')
	    );
	}

=> Assuming we have a file named “wp-content/plugins/hello-world.php” with the following content. What is this missing to be called a plugin and run properly?
<?php
add_filter('the_content', 'hello_world');
function hello_world($content){
    return $content . "<h1> Hello World </h1>";
}
	The file is missing the plugin headers. Every plugin should include at least the plugin name in the header with the following syntax:

	<?php
	/*
	Plugin Name: My hello world plugin
	*/

=> What is a potential problem in the following snippet of code from a WordPress theme file named “footer.php”?
...
        </section><!—end of body section- ->
        <footer>All rights reserved</footer>
    </body>
</html>
	All footer files must call the <?php wp_footer() ?> function, ideally right before the </body> tag. This will insert references to all scripts and stylesheets that have been added by plugins, themes, and WordPress itself to the footer.

=> What is this code for? How can the end user use it?
function new_shortcode($atts, $content = null) {
    extract(shortcode_atts(array(
        “type” => “warning”
    ), $atts));
    return '<div class="alert alert-'.$type.'">'.$content.'</div>';
}
add_shortcode(“warning_box”, “new_shortcode”);

	This shortcode allows authors to show an info box in posts or pages where the shortcode itself is added. The HTML code generated is a div with a class name “alert” plus an extra class name by default, “alert-warning”. A parameter can change this second class to change the visual aspect of the alert box.

	Those class naming structures are compatible with Bootstrap.

	To use this shortcode, the user has to insert the following code within the body of a post or a page:

	[warning_box]Warning message[/warning_box]

=> Is WordPress safe from brute force login attempts? If not, how can you prevent such an attack vector?
	No, WordPress on its own is vulnerable to brute force login attempts.
	Some good examples of actions performed to protect a WordPress installation against brute force are:
	Do not use the “admin” username, and use strong passwords.
	Password protect “wp-login.php”.
	Set up some server-side protections (IP-based restrictions, firewall, Apache/Nginx modules, etc.)
	Install a plugin to add a captcha, or limit login attempts.

=> The following line is in a function inside a theme’s “function.php” file. What is wrong with this line of code?
wp_enqueue_script('custom-script', '/js/functions.js');
	Assuming that “functions.js” file is in the theme’s “js/” folder, we should use ‘get_template_directory_uri()’. '/js/functions.js' or the visitors’ browser will look for the file in the root directory of the website.

=> Suppose you have a non-WordPress PHP website with a WordPress instance in the “/blog/” folder. How can you show a list of the last 3 posts in your non-WordPress pages?

	One obvious way is to download, parse, and cache the blog’s RSS feeds. However, since the blog and the website are on the same server, you can use all the WordPress power, even outside it.

	The first thing to do is to include the “wp-load.php” file. After which you will be able to perform any WP_Query and use any WordPress function such as get_posts, wp_get_recent_posts, query_posts, and so on.

	<?php
    require_once('../blog/wp-load.php');
	?>
	<h2>Recent Posts</h2>
	<ul>
	<?php
    $recent_posts = wp_get_recent_posts(array(‘numberposts’=>3));
    foreach($recent_posts as $recent){
        echo '<li><a href="' . get_permalink($recent["ID"]) . '">' . $recent["post_title"] . '</a></li> ';
    }
	?>
	</ul>

=> What are hooks and define types of hooks in WordPress?
	Hooks are provided by WordPress to allow your plugin to ‘hook into’ the rest of WordPress; that is, to call functions in your plugin at specific times, and thereby set your plugin in motion. There are two kinds of hooks:

	Actions Hooks: Actions hooks are the hooks that the WordPress core launches at specific points during execution, or when specific events occur. Your plugin can specify that one or more of its PHP functions which are executed at these points, using the Action API.

	Filters Hooks: Filters hooks are the hooks that WordPress launches to modify text of various types before adding it to the database or sending it to the browser screen. Your plugin can specify that one or more of its PHP functions which are executed to modify specific types of text at these times, using the Filter API.

	Actions Functions:
	has_action()
	add_action()
	do_action()
	do_action_ref_array()
	did_action()

=> How will you retrieve adjacent posts (next/previous) within the same category?
	We can retrieve previous post using get_adjacent_post() function and providing it ‘true‘ and taxonomy name in first and last parameters respectively. Setting third parameter to false will bring next adjacent post in front of you.

=> How to create Custom Taxonomy specific to a Custom Post type?
	First of all if you want to show taxonomy metabox only to custom post type then register the taxonomy to only that custom post type by passing the custom post type name as argument in register_taxonomy(). By doing this the taxonomy metabox appears only to custom post type.

=> How To Activate Plugins via Code?
	Plugins are stored in an array in the ‘active_plugins‘ option. The array contains the file path to each plugin that is active. To activate a plugin you need to determine what it’s path will be, then pass that path to activate_plugin($plugin_path).

	Before you can call activate_plugin() you need to include the plugin.php file from wp-admin/includes/. You should also check to make sure your plugin isn’t already active. The result looks something like this:

	Activate Plugins via Code

=>  What’s the difference between site_url() and home_url()?
	The site_url() will always be the location where you can reach the site by tacking on /wp-admin on the end, while home_url() would not reliably be this location. The home_url() would be where you have set your homepage by setting General > Settings “Site Address (URL)” field.
